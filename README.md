# SPOJ-Solutions
This is a repository containing my own solutions of selected problems from SPOJ(Spherical Online Judge).

As Wikipedia says, "SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is an online judge system with over 315,000 registered users and over 20,000 problems. Tasks are prepared by its community of problem setters or are taken from previous programming contests. SPOJ allows advanced users to organize contests under their own rules and also includes a forum where programmers can discuss how to solve a particular problem."

All my solutions are written in C++, a language I prefer the most.

Few solutions require a big integer library, which is a custom library in c++ for dealing with very large integers. The library is also written by me, and you will find it in a seperate repository by the same name.

Feel free to ping me for any doubt regarding the solutions. I would be very happy to help you. You may also suggest a better approach to any problem. Just drop in a pull request.
